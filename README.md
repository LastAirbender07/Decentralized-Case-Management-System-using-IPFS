## Introduction
Blockchain's decentralization and immutability offer promising solutions for managing sensitive information. This project explores the utilization of blockchain and IPFS to address challenges in case management, providing a secure and transparent platform for storing and accessing case data.

## Proposed Methodology
The methodology involves designing a system architecture that integrates blockchain and IPFS, selecting appropriate technologies, developing smart contracts for access control, and rigorous testing to ensure functionality and security. The system architecture leverages blockchain for secure data storage and IPFS for decentralized file storage and retrieval. Smart contracts define access control rules, ensuring only authorized users can manage cases.

Ethereum blockchain is chosen for its robust ecosystem and smart contract capabilities. Solidity is used to develop smart contracts, while IPFS provides distributed file storage. Smart contracts encode access control mechanisms, defining roles and permissions for different users. Solidity is utilized to implement contract logic, ensuring interoperability with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. IPFS protocol is integrated into the system to facilitate decentralized file storage and retrieval. This ensures data availability and integrity, reducing reliance on centralized servers.
